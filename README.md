# Client-Server-Playground

Run the server.py script on your (Windows) machine you want to control and the client script on the client. 
For now, you can set the server to sleep if you pass "sleep" as a starting argument and you can stop the server
by passing "exit" as a starting argument. In addition to that, you can adjust the master volume of the Spotify application and set the volume from 0 to 100. 

In the near future, this little project will be expanded with CI features to learn some basic stuff with that and in addition 
multiple new features are planed.
